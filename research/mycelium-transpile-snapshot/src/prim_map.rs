//! Forward-map the **known kernel Π prim/API surface** into Rust `Expr::MethodCall` intrinsic
//! patterns, AHEAD of any backend that isn't fully wired yet (trx2 Lane C Deliverable 2).
//!
//! **VERIFY-FIRST (mitigation #14) — every row here traces to a checked citation, never a
//! doc-derived guess.** Two states, both never-silent (G2):
//!
//! - **`wired: true`** — the kernel prim is landed (confirmed in
//!   `crates/mycelium-l1/src/checkty.rs`'s `prim_kernel_name`/`prim_sig` tables) AND this crate
//!   independently confirmed the *exact emitted surface text* checks clean with the real built
//!   `target/debug/myc` (see each row's citation for the probe). [`emit_expr_inner`]'s
//!   `Expr::MethodCall` arm emits the real call for these.
//! - **`wired: false`** — a **PENDING-BACKEND** row: the mapping is *known* (a decided ADR/RFC/DN
//!   ruling), but the runtime/grammar backend is not landed yet. The emitter NEVER emits text for
//!   these — it always refuses with a structured [`crate::gap::GapReason`] citing the ruling
//!   (VR-5/G2: a forward-declared mapping is documentation + a precise gap, never a fabricated
//!   success).
//!
//! # What is deliberately **excluded** from this table (verify-first findings, not oversights)
//!
//! The kickoff brief's WIRED list also named `bit.mul` (`mul_u`) and `bit.popcount`/`bit.clz`/
//! `bit.ctz` (CU-1/CU-6) — both genuinely kernel-landed
//! (`docs/notes/DN-34-Rust-to-Mycelium-Transpiler-Strategy.md` §8.16: Π 59→66, PRs #1273/#1275/
//! #1291). They are **not** rows here because no Rust `Expr::MethodCall` pattern was found that is
//! *faithful* to their calling convention:
//! - `mul_u(a, b) -> Binary{N}` refuses (a runtime `Overflow`) rather than returning `Option` —
//!   Rust's semantically-closest never-silent method, `.checked_mul(rhs) -> Option<T>`, is a real
//!   corpus idiom (`crates/mycelium-std-math/src/exact.rs:273`), but its VALUE SHAPE does not match
//!   (`Option[Binary{N}]` vs bare `Binary{N}`) — mapping the isolated call node would emit a
//!   *type-mismatched* body wherever the `Option` is actually consumed (the realistic case). Rust's
//!   `.wrapping_mul()` is the wrong direction entirely (silently wraps — the G2 anti-pattern this
//!   whole project exists to avoid).
//! - `popcount`/`clz`/`ctz` are **width-preserving** (`Binary{N} -> Binary{N}`,
//!   `crates/mycelium-l1/src/checkty.rs:7164`), but Rust's `.count_ones()`/`.leading_zeros()`/
//!   `.trailing_zeros()` **always return a fixed `u32`** regardless of receiver width — so any
//!   *real, compiling* Rust source using them has an enclosing `u32`-typed context, which maps to
//!   `Binary{32}` and mismatches a `Binary{N}`-shaped body for every `N != 32`.
//!
//! Under `src/tests/vet.rs`'s **file-gated all-or-nothing** `myc check` classification
//! (`checked_clean_items_is_file_gated_all_or_nothing`), a wrongly-typed `wired: true` emission
//! does not just miss an opportunity — it can cost a whole file's `checked_fraction`. Both CU-1 and
//! CU-6 are already reachable through the sanctioned route instead: Deliverable 1's `Expr::Binary`
//! operand-type-gated rewrite (`&`/`|` -> `and`/`or`; DN-34 §8.16 item 4 names exactly this as
//! *the* transpiler-side path for these units). Forcing a second, unfaithful Call/MethodCall
//! binding here would be the "guessed API" VR-5 forbids — reported as a FLAG, not guessed.
//!
//! # L4 (DN-136 Phase-2, M-1100) — conversion-method mapping, verify-first findings
//!
//! **`clone` ADDED (identity, `wired: true`), narrowed post-hoc by the PR #1552 review
//! (CRITICAL soundness fix).** `Clone::clone`'s sole effect (per Rust's own contract) is producing
//! an owned copy with **no representation change** — in a value-semantic grammar (ADR-003) that is
//! exactly identity, **but only when the receiver's type cannot itself carry a user-written,
//! non-derived `impl Clone`** that does something other than a field-for-field copy (Rust allows
//! exactly that on any local type — the review's reproduced repro: a `struct Ticket{id,gen}` with a
//! hand-written `clone` that bumps `gen`; the original `ReceiverGate::AnyKnown` gate silently fired
//! on it, dropping the bump and reporting a clean success). The frozen [`crate::emit`]
//! call-emission format is always `"{myc_prim}({args})"` (`emit.rs`'s `visit_method_call`,
//! unchanged by this leaf); a row with `myc_prim: ""` therefore emits `"(recv)"` — a
//! **parenthesized-grouping** expression (`primary ::= ... | '(' expr ')'`,
//! `docs/spec/grammar/mycelium.ebnf:406`), confirmed `myc-check`-clean and semantically identical
//! to the bare receiver by direct probe against `target/debug/myc-check` for a `Binary{64}`,
//! `Bool`, and `Bytes` receiver (this leaf's own `src/tests/prim_map.rs` carries the committed
//! regression + a live-oracle witness covering exactly those three receiver types — `u64`/`bool`/
//! `String`). A user struct receiver and a `match`-block receiver expression were manually probed
//! against `target/debug/myc-check` during development (both also emit clean, unchanged, syntax)
//! but that probe is **not** committed as a live-oracle case, and is no longer this row's live
//! behavior anyway — see below. Gated on [`ReceiverGate::AnyBuiltinScalar`] (the receiver's mapped
//! type must be exactly `Bool`/`Bytes`/some concrete `Binary{N}` — i.e. a Rust *primitive* source
//! type, whose `Clone` impl is std's own fixed field-copy and categorically cannot be a user
//! override, per Rust's orphan rule) rather than [`ReceiverGate::AnyKnown`]: a user-named-type
//! receiver (a `struct`/`enum` that resolves but isn't a builtin) now **gaps** — never-silent
//! (G2), never a guessed identity — instead of silently assuming its `Clone` is trivial. See
//! `src/tests/prim_map.rs`'s `clone_on_user_named_type_receiver_never_fires_identity_and_gaps` for
//! the reviewer's exact repro as a regression (confirmed to fail under the pre-fix `AnyKnown`
//! gate, confirmed to pass under `AnyBuiltinScalar`).
//!
//! **`to_owned` ADDED (identity, `wired: true`), the flagged M-1100 residual closed** (this leaf).
//! Same semantic bucket as `clone`
//! (`crate::emit::is_unmappable_conversion_method`'s own doc comment groups both under
//! "ownership/representation identity"): `ToOwned::to_owned`'s value on a receiver whose mapped
//! type is a fixed builtin/primitive scalar is exactly the trait's blanket-`Clone` behavior
//! (`bool`/`u8..u128`/`i8..i128`/`usize`/`isize`/`char` all implement `Clone`, so
//! `to_owned(&self) -> T { self.clone() }` applies) or, for `str`/`String` (both mapping to the
//! builtin scalar `Bytes` — `crate::type_map::TABLE`'s `String`/`str` rows), std's own explicit
//! `impl ToOwned for str { type Owned = String; .. }` — in both cases an owned copy with **no
//! representation change** (ADR-003 value semantics), so the receiver passed through unchanged is
//! exact. Gated identically to `clone` — [`ReceiverGate::AnyBuiltinScalar`] — for the identical
//! reason: Rust's orphan rule forecloses a downstream `impl ToOwned` for any of these foreign
//! primitive types, so identity is sound **only** for this fixed set; a user-named-type receiver
//! still GAPS (never-silent, VR-5/G2), because `ToOwned`'s `Owned` associated type need not even
//! equal `Self` for a user impl (std's own `str -> String`/`[T] -> Vec<T>` show `Owned != Self` is
//! a normal, sanctioned shape), so assuming identity there would be an unchecked guess. The
//! previously-FLAGged blocker — the existing lock in
//! `src/tests/emit.rs::conversion_noop_method_gaps_never_fabricates_unknown_prim` (the "#72
//! co-poison fix") asserting `fn f(s: &str) -> String { s.to_owned() }` gaps the WHOLE function —
//! is resolved by updating that one test's now-stale bare-identifier-receiver case to assert
//! identity instead. **M-1037 residual** further types string/bool/char *literals* in
//! [`crate::emit::expr_env_type`], so `"a".to_owned()` / `"a".to_string()` / `"a".clone()` now
//! also fire the identity rows (fixed Rust types → `Bytes`/`Bool`/`Binary{32}` — never integer/
//! float literals, whose width is inference-dependent).
//!
//! **`to_string` ADDED for `Bytes` only (M-1037 residual).** `str`/`String` both map to the
//! builtin scalar `Bytes`; `ToString`/`Display` for those types is a content-preserving owned
//! `String` — representation identity under ADR-003, same orphan-rule soundness as `to_owned`.
//! Gated on [`ReceiverGate::Exact`]`("Bytes")` — **not** [`AnyBuiltinScalar`]:
//! `Binary{N}`/`Bool`.to_string()` is Display formatting, not identity. DN-127/DN-129 landed
//! `impl Show[…]` with `render(x) => Bytes`, and a live probe against `target/debug/myc-check`
//! confirmed bare `render(recv)` fails single-file as `unknown function/constructor/prim render`
//! (Show is prelude-seeded only when a linked nodule declares an impl — DN-129 §5; the
//! `checked_fraction` vet metric is single-file). Emitting `render` for non-Bytes receivers would
//! fabricate a check-failing call — left gapped with a method-specific EXPLAIN instead (see
//! `emit::conversion_gap_reason`).
//!
//! **`into` NOT ADDED (honest residual gap).** `Into::into`'s target type is determined by Rust's
//! bidirectional type inference from the *call site's expected type* (an assignment target, a
//! return position, …) — this `syn`-level, per-expression table has no expected-type context at
//! all (only [`crate::emit::TypeEnv`]'s *receiver*-type tracking), so "identity when source/target
//! coincide" is undecidable here without guessing the target. Gapped with a method-specific
//! EXPLAIN (`emit::conversion_gap_reason("into")`), never a fabricated bare `into(recv)`.
//!
//! **M-1037 accessor identity rows (`as_ref`/`borrow`/`as_str`/`as_slice`/`deref`).** On a fixed
//! builtin/primitive mapped receiver (`AnyBuiltinScalar`), these `AsRef`/`Borrow`/`Deref` trait
//! methods are representation-preserving in value-semantic Mycelium (ADR-003): the receiver passed
//! through as `(recv)` is exact for the same orphan-rule soundness basis as `clone`/`to_owned`.
//! `as_mut`/`borrow_mut`/`deref_mut` stay gapped (mutable-reference surface is not value-safe
//! without DN-125 threading facts). **`to_vec` stays gapped** (not identity — allocates a new
//! `Seq`; no verified bare-call Seq-copy prim; method-specific EXPLAIN).
//!
//! CU-3 (float<->int conversion) is also excluded: DN-34 §8.16 records a *directional* ruling
//! ("prims for the total directions") but no confirmed prim **name**, and Rust's natural spelling
//! for a value conversion is the `as` cast (`syn::Expr::Cast`), which is out of this `Call`/
//! `MethodCall` table's scope regardless (`emit.rs`'s dedicated `Expr::Cast` arm handles casts, not
//! this table — see that arm's own doc comment). **Update (DN-51 §2 D3/§6, maintainer-authorized
//! DN-39 post-freeze promotion):** the *int-narrowing* sibling of "conversion"
//! (`Binary{N} as Binary{M}`, `M < N`) is now landed and emits `truncate` — but that fix lives
//! entirely in `emit.rs`'s `Expr::Cast` arm (mirroring how `Binary{N} as Binary{M}` widening
//! already emitted `width_cast` there, never via this table), so it does not add a row here. This
//! CU-3 exclusion is unchanged and still applies exactly to the **float-crossing** cast forms
//! (`Binary{N} as Float`, `Float as Binary{N}`, `Float as Float`), which remain
//! `PENDING-DESIGN(CU-3-fidelity)` — no faithful prim exists for those (ADR-040 §2.4's checked/
//! refusing CU-3 prims don't match Rust `as`'s rounding/saturating float semantics). CU-7
//! (arbitrary-width ternary) is excluded
//! because its natural Rust shape (`BigTernary::add/sub/mul/neg`,
//! `crates/mycelium-core/src/ternary/big_ternary.rs`) uses fully generic method names that collide
//! with an enormous space of unrelated Rust code (`.add()`/`.sub()`/`.mul()`/`.neg()` are common
//! method names on user types) — keying a table row on the bare name alone would misattribute
//! unrelated calls, and the target surface name is itself undecided (DN-34: "needs the
//! growable-`Repr::Ternary` decision"). CU-8 (atomics) and CU-9 (Dense dtype/quant) are excluded
//! per DN-34's own explicit rulings: CU-8 "needs a memory-model RFC ... mint a tracked issue + an
//! RFC stub; do **not** scope a partial stub" (an explicit no-half-measures instruction this row
//! would violate), and CU-9 "rides the E20-1 content-address rehash" (blocked on an unrelated
//! architectural decision, no shape decided at all). All five are reported as FLAGs in the leaf's
//! final report rather than forward-mapped as guesses.
