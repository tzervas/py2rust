//! DN-136/P1-a — the derive-rule emit-hook axis (Alt B: a static per-axis handler table
//! generalizing the already-landed `prim_map::TABLE` registry, `prim_map.rs:140`).
//!
//! **The two-level guarantee this axis must NOT collapse (DN-136 §3 item 2 / §7, DN-128):**
//! 1. **Per-derived-impl atomicity lives in the *rule* (a row's `emit`).** `derive_show_impl`/
//!    `derive_init_impl` (now [`show::compose`]/[`init::compose`]) refuse the **whole** impl the
//!    moment any field is ineligible — never a partial impl. Moved verbatim; unchanged.
//! 2. **Per-derive independence across the set lives in the *driver*
//!    ([`crate::emit::lower_struct_derives`]), which this axis does NOT touch.** The driver still
//!    owns: the attribute/derive-list walk, routing each derive's [`DeriveOutcome`] to
//!    `impls`/`sub_gaps`/`unrecognized`, and the item-still-emits compose-eligible-sub-gap-the-
//!    rest orchestration. A row can add a NEW derive rule; it can never move that orchestration
//!    out of the driver (a build-blocking review check, DN-136 §8 point 2(e)).
//!
//! A row's `recognizes` matches the derive's **trait-path text** (e.g. `"Debug"`); `emit` gets a
//! [`DeriveCtx`] carrying everything the pre-refactor inline arms closed over (`ty_name`,
//! `field_types`, `is_generic`, and the matched `name` — needed because the `Clone`/`Copy` row
//! interpolates which of the two fired into its satisfied-no-op message, exactly as the
//! pre-refactor `"Clone" | "Copy"` arm did with its shared `name` binding).
