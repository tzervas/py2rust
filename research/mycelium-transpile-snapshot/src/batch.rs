///    item-name set — the only names a sibling's `use` may ever resolve to (a name that merely
///    exists in the Rust source but itself gapped is never a valid target; VR-5/G2).

///    file's emitted names under its derived (same-crate-bare, or crate-qualified when a real crate
///    identity is derivable — M-1084) key; [`scan_pub_needed`] then walks every file's `use` items
///    (a cheap re-parse, no full re-dispatch) to find which sibling names at least one OTHER file in
///    the batch actually resolves against — the `pub`-propagation input the final pass needs
///    (DN-113/M-1060's `resolve_imports` only accepts a `pub` cross-nodule name; emitting a resolved
///    `use` against a non-`pub` sibling item would be the exact "plausible but wrong" emission
///    VR-5/G2 forbid). Accumulated by the target sibling's own **nodule path** (stable and
///    lookup-perspective-independent — the same physical sibling may be reached via more than one
///    lookup key, e.g. both a same-crate and a cross-phylum reference in different consumer files).
/// 3. **Final pass** — re-transpile every file via [`transpile_file_with_ctx`] with the symbol
///    table and this file's own pub-needed set (looked up by ITS OWN derived nodule path) installed,
///    so `use crate::<mod>::Item`/`self::`/`super::`/a cross-phylum `use <phylum>::<mod>::Item`
///    resolves against a genuine in-batch sibling and the referenced item is emitted `pub`.
///
/// A single-file batch (or one whose files carry no in-batch cross-referencing `use`) degenerates
/// to byte-identical output vs. the pre-lever driver (no sibling ⇒ nothing resolves). A multi-crate
/// batch (M-1084: e.g. a `--files` invocation spanning more than one crate's `src/`) is the vehicle
/// for cross-phylum resolution — every file's own crate identity is derived from ITS OWN real repo
/// path (`transpile::derive_crate_ident`), so files from different crates never collide on a bare
/// (unqualified) key.
///
/// **ONESHOT L2-B phase-2:** baseline `.myc` type lines are indexed into the symbol table
